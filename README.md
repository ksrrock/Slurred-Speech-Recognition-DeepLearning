# Slurred-Speech-Recognition-DeepLearning
Deep learning has evolved a lot to develop end to end state of the art speech Recognition System.
End to end deep learning model for automatic speech Recognition is much simpler than traditional speech systems which tend to perform poorly in noisy enviroments. Deep learning End to End models doesn't need hand designed components to model background noise and speaker variation.

The well known Automatic Speech Recognition Systems are Alexa, Siri , Google Home etc. This class of applications starts with clip of spoken audio clip in a particular language and extracts the words that were spoken as text. There are also called Speech to Text Algorithms

# Problem Statement
The state of the art Automatic Speech Recognition can greatly improve the lives of those with speech impairements. However , The end to end deep learning Automatic Speech Recognition System trained from 'normal' speech tend to perform poorly for those who have speech impairements either due to accident or disease. The purpose is to improve ASR for people who have speech impairements or have non-standard speech.
