# Slurred-Speech-Recognition-DeepLearning
Deep learning has evolved a lot to develop end to end state of the art speech Recognition System.
End to end deep learning model for automatic speech Recognition is much simpler than traditional speech systems which tend to perform poorly in noisy enviroments. Deep learning End to End models doesn't need hand designed components to model background noise and speaker variation.
